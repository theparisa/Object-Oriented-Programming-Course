# Object-Oriented-Programming-Course

The goal of this course is to introduce methods for developing high-quality software using the C++ programming language. The main focus is on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** as a powerful tool for managing the complexity of medium to large-scale applications. Advanced topics such as **Design Patterns**, **Unit Testing**, and **Code Refactoring** are also introduced to build robust and maintainable code.

## Key Concepts Covered: 
* **_Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming_**
* **_Inheritance, Dynamic Binding, & Polymorphism_**
* **_Basic Principles of Object-Oriented Design_**
* **_Memory Management & Smart Pointers_**
* **_Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL)_**
* **_Exception Handling_**
* **_Recursive Problem Solving & Backtracking_**
